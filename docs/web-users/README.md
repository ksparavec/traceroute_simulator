## Running Network Tests

### Test Form Overview

The main test form allows you to specify:

#### Source Information
- **Source IP Address**: The starting point of your network trace
  - Example: `10.1.1.1`
  - Must be a valid IP address in your network

#### Destination Information
- **Destination IP Address**: The target endpoint
  - Example: `10.2.1.1` or `8.8.8.8`
  - Can be internal or external IP

#### Service Testing (Optional)
- **Port Number**: TCP/UDP port to test
  - Example: `80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS
  - Range: 1-65535
- **Protocol**: Select TCP or UDP
  - TCP: Connection-oriented services
  - UDP: Connectionless services

### Running a Test

1. **Fill in the Form**
   ```
   Source IP: 10.1.1.1
   Destination IP: 10.2.1.1
   Port: 443
   Protocol: TCP
   ```

2. **Submit the Test**
   - Click "Run Test" button
   - Progress indicator will appear
   - Wait for results (typically 5-30 seconds)

3. **View Results**
   - Results appear below the form
   - Download PDF report if needed
   - Run additional tests as required

### Test Types

#### Basic Connectivity Test
- Tests if packets can reach from source to destination
- Shows the complete network path
- Identifies blocking points

#### Service Test
- Verifies if specific services are accessible
- Tests both connectivity and port availability
- Useful for troubleshooting application issues

## Understanding Test Results

### Result Components

#### 1. Path Summary
Shows the route packets take through your network:
```
Source: 10.1.1.1 (hq-gw)
  ‚Üì
Router: hq-gw (10.1.1.1)
  Interface: eth1 ‚Üí wg0
  ‚Üì
Router: br-gw (10.100.1.2)
  Interface: wg0 ‚Üí eth1
  ‚Üì
Destination: 10.2.1.1 (br-gw)
```

#### 2. Connectivity Status

**‚úÖ REACHABLE**
- Packets can successfully reach the destination
- All firewalls allow the traffic
- Routing is properly configured

**‚ùå BLOCKED**
- Traffic is blocked by firewall rules
- Shows which router blocks the traffic
- Indicates the specific rule causing the block

**‚ö†Ô∏è NO ROUTE**
- No network path exists to destination
- Routing configuration issue
- May need VPN or gateway configuration

#### 3. Firewall Analysis

For each router in the path:
- **Allowed Rules**: Rules that permit the traffic
- **Blocked Rules**: Rules that deny the traffic
- **Default Action**: What happens if no rules match

Example output:
```
Router: hq-gw
Status: FORWARDING ALLOWED
Matching Rule: -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o wg0 -j ACCEPT
Packet Count: 15,234
```

#### 4. Performance Metrics
- **Test Duration**: How long the analysis took
- **Hop Count**: Number of routers in the path
- **MTU**: Maximum packet size supported

### Interpreting Colors and Icons

- üü¢ **Green/Check**: Traffic allowed, test passed
- üî¥ **Red/X**: Traffic blocked, test failed
- üü° **Yellow/Warning**: Partial success or warnings
- üîµ **Blue/Info**: Informational messages

## Complex Policy Routing Strategy

### Additional Routing Tables Per Router
1. **priority_table (table 100)**: High-priority traffic routing
   - Management traffic (SSH, SNMP, monitoring)
   - Critical infrastructure communication
   - Emergency and backup routes

2. **service_table (table 200)**: Service-specific routing
   - Web services routing (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - Database traffic routing
   - Application-specific paths

3. **backup_table (table 300)**: Backup and failover routing
   - Alternative paths for redundancy
   - Load balancing scenarios
   - Disaster recovery routes

4. **qos_table (table 400)**: Quality of Service routing
   - Real-time traffic prioritization
   - Bandwidth allocation routing
   - Traffic shaping integration

### Policy Rule Categories (Minimum 3 per Router)

#### Source-Based Policies
- **Network segment isolation**: Different source networks use different routing tables
- **User/role-based routing**: Admin networks vs user networks
- **Location-based routing**: Inter-site vs intra-site traffic

#### Service-Based Policies  
- **Port-based routing**: Different services use different paths
- **Protocol-based routing**: TCP vs UDP vs ICMP routing
- **Application-aware routing**: Specific applications get dedicated paths

#### QoS-Based Policies
- **Priority-based routing**: High-priority traffic gets faster paths
- **Bandwidth-based routing**: Different bandwidth requirements
- **Latency-sensitive routing**: Real-time applications get optimized paths

#### Time-Based Policies
- **Business hours routing**: Different routes during peak/off-peak
- **Maintenance window routing**: Backup paths during maintenance
- **Load balancing routing**: Dynamic path selection

#### Failover and Redundancy Policies
- **Primary/backup routing**: Automatic failover scenarios  
- **Multi-path routing**: Load balancing across multiple paths
- **Geo-redundancy routing**: Cross-location backup paths

### Advanced Routing Scenarios

#### Multi-Homed Routing
```bash
# Example: Different ISPs for different traffic types
ip rule add from 10.1.0.0/16 table isp1_table priority 100
ip rule add from 10.2.0.0/16 table isp2_table priority 101
ip rule add tos 0x10 table priority_table priority 50
```

#### Application-Specific Routing  
```bash
# Example: Database traffic uses dedicated paths
ip rule add dport 3306 table database_table priority 200
ip rule add dport 5432 table database_table priority 201
ip rule add sport 3306 table database_table priority 202
```

#### Source/Destination Combination Policies
```bash
# Example: Specific source/destination pairs
ip rule add from 10.1.10.0/24 to 10.3.20.0/24 table datacenter_table priority 150
ip rule add from 10.1.3.0/24 to 192.168.0.0/16 table dmz_table priority 160
```

#### Mark-Based Routing
```bash
# Example: Packet marking integration with routing
ip rule add fwmark 0x1 table priority_table priority 75
ip rule add fwmark 0x2 table service_table priority 175
ip rule add fwmark 0x3 table backup_table priority 275
```

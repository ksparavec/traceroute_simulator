# Scenario 11: CROWN TEST - Multiple detailed + multiple quick jobs on overlapping routers
# This is the most complex scenario testing all conflict resolution logic
# Format: trace_file ; analysis_mode ; dest_ports

# Detailed job 1: Uses routers A, B, C
/path/to/traces/trace_routerA_routerB_routerC.json ; detailed ; 80,443

# Detailed job 2: Uses routers B, C, D (overlaps with Detailed 1 - MUST queue)
/path/to/traces/trace_routerB_routerC_routerD.json ; detailed ; 80,443

# Detailed job 3: Uses routers X, Y, Z (no overlap with 1 or 2 - can run parallel)
/path/to/traces/trace_routerX_routerY_routerZ.json ; detailed ; 22,8080

# Quick job 1: Uses routers A, B (overlaps with Detailed 1 - queued)
/path/to/traces/trace_routerA_routerB.json ; quick ; 3306,5432

# Quick job 2: Uses routers D, E (overlaps with Detailed 2 - queued)
/path/to/traces/trace_routerD_routerE.json ; quick ; 6379,27017

# Quick job 3: Uses routers P, Q (no overlap - can run)
/path/to/traces/trace_routerP_routerQ.json ; quick ; 8080,8443

# Quick job 4: Uses routers Q, R (overlaps with Quick 3 - OK, both quick)

# Quick job 5: Uses routers X, Y (overlaps with Detailed 3 - queued)
